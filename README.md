The crate contains ripped modules from [bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/) library
that are useful for serialization/deserialization of network protocols with binary format with fixed  
external specification.

The modules are same as in https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/tree/2414c5b0a9bfeccb096ead3596b437dd7b8a8e5e
but Bitcoin specific parts are removed.
